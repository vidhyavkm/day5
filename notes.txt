code reusuablilty=> functions 

how to create a function:
every function should begin with the keyword function
function name should be unique
a list parameters should be inside the () seperated by commos
{}list of statement composing the body of the function .

syntax:
function (){}
it always has a return value.

if we dont use return key word inside the paranthesis we will get the output as undefined .

console.log
return (important)
once the return keyword happens it should not allow others to work

parameters:
the things that get passed within the function. 
arguments:
the things get passed when the function is called.

types of functions :

named function
anonymous function(without name)- it should declare by a variable name 
IIFE- immediately invoked function expression - it doesnt have a return value, no need to call with the name of the function
arrow function- it has or dotn have return value, but it has no key word called function(=>).

named function syntax: function foo(){return()}

anonymous function syntax: variable variablename = function () {return}

IIFE: memory used is very less, time less ... syntax: (function(){})();

arrow function:
latest version of function es6. syntax: variable = () => {};
it is used in a single line.
